# Deep Active Learning with Semidefinite Embedding for Batch Sampling

This repository contains the code of "Deep Active Learning 
with Semidefinite Embedding for Batch Sampling" where two 
datasets are used in the implementation, e.g. MNIST and ROP 
datasets. In both folders, .npy files are the distance 
matrices created using "create_distance_matrix" .py files 
from the output of the SDE component of the project. Then, using
different versions of "training_classifier" .py files, the 
training process that includes active learning can be done.
